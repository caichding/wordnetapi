lemma
    lower case ASCII text of word or collocation. Collocations are formed by joining individual words with an underscore (_ ) character. 
pos
    Syntactic category: n for noun files, v for verb files, a for adjective files, r for adverb files. 

All remaining fields are with respect to senses of lemma in pos .

synset_cnt
    Number of synsets that lemma is in. This is the number of senses of the word in WordNet. See Sense Numbers below for a discussion of how sense numbers are assigned and the order of synset_offset s in the index files. 
p_cnt
    Number of different pointers that lemma has in all synsets containing it. 
ptr_symbol
    A space separated list of p_cnt different types of pointers that lemma has in all synsets containing it. See wninput(5WN) for a list of pointer_symbol s. If all senses of lemma have no pointers, this field is omitted and p_cnt is 0 . 
sense_cnt
    Same as sense_cnt above. This is redundant, but the field was preserved for compatibility reasons. 
tagsense_cnt
    Number of senses of lemma that are ranked according to their frequency of occurrence in semantic concordance texts. 
synset_offset
    Byte offset in data.pos file of a synset containing lemma . Each synset_offset in the list corresponds to a different sense of lemma in WordNet. synset_offset is an 8 digit, zero-filled decimal integer that can be used with fseek(3) to read a synset from the data file. When passed to read_synset(3WN) along with the syntactic category, a data structure containing the parsed synset is returned.
